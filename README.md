# Quasar Typescript template

This repo is an example on how components interact using Typescript, Quasar (Vue) with Typescript aliases set up.

The actual demo application is not at all intended to be useful with the code structure and config being the whole point

NOTE: I didn't come across the need in the demo to explicitly inclue the vue-shim.d.ts included in the offical [Typescript-Vue-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter/tree/master/src) template.
It looks like this it accounted for by the default Vue typescript definitions (node_modules/vue/types/*.d.ts)
